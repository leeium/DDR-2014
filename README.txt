Welcome to the beta 1.1 version of the DDR 2014 (1280x720) theme for Stepmania 5. We have 
tried to make it as accurate as possible using recreated graphics, sounds and coding. 

Coming soon:
- eAmuse(ish) system. I have the ideas, just not the coding 
  know-how.
- Cut-ins. It's not 100% necessary but it'll be there.
- Target score, should I ever figure out how to do it.

Screens left to update:
- ScreenGameplay
- ScreenSelectStyle
- ScreenSelectMode
There's nothing wrong with these but we plan to redo the graphics.

Anywho, Enjoy and feel free to modify.

Codes:
For more efficient use of these codes make sure to have 
      Menu and Gameplay buttons mapped to different keys.
		Example for P1: Left  = [G]	MenuLeft  = [LEFT]	Select  = [/]
			 	Down  = [H]	MenuDown  = [DOWN]	Confirm = [ENTER]
			 	Up    = [Y]	MenuUp    = [UP]
			 	Right = [J]     MenuRight = [RIGHT]

		Example for P2: Left  = [K]	MenuLeft  = [KP4]	Select  = [KP0]
			 	Down  = [L]	MenuDown  = [KP2]	Confirm = [KPENTER]
			 	Up    = [O]	MenuUp    = [KP8]
			 	Right = [:]     MenuRight = [KP6]
