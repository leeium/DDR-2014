DDR 2014 - SM5 Theme
====================

Info
----
Welcome to the beta 1.1 version of the DDR 2014 (1280x720) theme for [StepMania 5](http://www.stepmania.com/). We have 
tried to make it as accurate as possible using recreated graphics, sounds and coding. 

**Coming soon:**

* eAmuse(ish) system. I have the ideas, just not the coding 
* know-how.
* Cut-ins. It's not 100% necessary but it'll be there.
* Target score, should I ever figure out how to do it.

**Screens left to update:**

* ScreenGameplay
* ScreenSelectStyle
* ScreenSelectMode

There's nothing wrong with these but we plan to redo the graphics.

Enjoy and feel free to modify.
